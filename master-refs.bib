abstract = {We present a new open source, extensible and flexible software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis called BEAST 2. This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

  abstract = {The order Passeriformes comprises the majority of extant avian species. Analyses of molecular data have provided important insights into the evolution of this diverse order. However, molecular estimates of the evolutionary and demographic timescales of passerine species have been hindered by a lack of reliable calibrations. This has led to a reliance on the application of standard substitution rates to mitochondrial DNA data, particularly rates estimated from analyses of the gene encoding cytochrome b (CYTB). To investigate patterns of rate variation across passerine lineages, we used a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to analyse the protein-coding genes of 183 mitochondrial genomes. We found that the most commonly used mitochondrial marker, CYTB, has low variation in rates across passerine lineages. This lends support to its widespread use as a molecular clock in birds. However, we also found that the patterns of among-lineage rate variation in CYTB are only weakly related to the evolutionary rate of the mitochondrial genome as a whole. Our analyses confirmed the presence of mutational saturation at third codon positions across the protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial genome, reinforcing the view that these sites should be excluded in studies of deep passerine relationships. The results of our analyses have provided information that will be useful for molecular-clock studies of passerine evolution.},

Often, the parameters of the site model is of no interest and an ad-hoc or additional likelihood based analysis is used to select a single site model.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of “relaxed phylogenetics.” Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

  abstract = {Evolution leaves heterogeneous patterns of nucleotide variation across the genome, with different loci subject to varying degrees of mutation, selection, and drift. In phylogenetics, the potential impacts of partitioning sequence data for the assignment of substitution models are well appreciated. In contrast, the treatment of branch lengths has received far less attention. In this study, we examined the effects of linking and unlinking branch-length parameters across loci or subsets of loci. By analyzing a range of empirical data sets, we find consistent support for a model in which branch lengths are proportionate between subsets of loci: gene trees share the same pattern of branch lengths, but form subsets that vary in their overall tree lengths. These models had substantially better statistical support than models that assume identical branch lengths across gene trees, or those in which genes form subsets with distinct branch-length patterns. We show using simulations and empirical data that the complexity of the branch-length model with the highest support depends on the length of the sequence alignment and on the numbers of taxa and loci in the data set. Our findings suggest that models in which branch lengths are proportionate between subsets have the highest statistical support under the conditions that are most commonly seen in practice. The results of our study have implications for model selection, computational efficiency, and experimental design in phylogenomics.},

  abstract = {Passerine birds are among the most diverse and species-rich groups of vertebrates, but the timescale of their evolution has been difficult to resolve with confidence. The fossil record of early passerines is relatively sparse and molecular-clock estimates of the passerine crown age have varied widely, with most previous studies relying on external fossil calibrations or assumptions relating to Gondwanan vicariance. In this study, we estimated the passerine evolutionary timescale by incorporating a set of 43 passerine fossils selected through a detailed assessment, while using a Bayesian tip-dating approach with the unresolved fossilized birth-death process. Our analyses ultimately place the passerine crown age in the Eocene, which largely closes the gap between molecular and palaeontological estimates of the passerine evolutionary timescale. Our date estimates are somewhat influenced by the prior probability density for the starting time of the diversification process. Through a simulation study, we show that the effect of the starting-time prior can be attenuated by the inclusion of morphological data for fossil and extant taxa. Overall, our study demonstrates that incorporating a curated, comprehensive set of fossils is effective in producing a well-resolved estimate of the passerine evolutionary timescale, while highlighting potential avenues for refining this estimate using Bayesian tip-dating analyses.},

  abstract = {Despite tremendous efforts in the past decades, relationships among main avian lineages remain heavily debated without a clear resolution. Discrepancies have been attributed to diversity of species sampled, phylogenetic method and the choice of genomic regions1–3. Here we address these issues by analysing the genomes of 363 bird species4 (218 taxonomic families, 92\% of total). Using intergenic regions and coalescent methods, we present a well-supported tree but also a marked degree of discordance. The tree confirms that Neoaves experienced rapid radiation at or near the Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary. Sufficient loci rather than extensive taxon sampling were more effective in resolving difficult nodes. Remaining recalcitrant nodes involve species that are a challenge to model due to either extreme DNA composition, variable substitution rates, incomplete lineage sorting or complex evolutionary events such as ancient hybridization. Assessment of the effects of different genomic partitions showed high heterogeneity across the genome. We discovered sharp increases in effective population size, substitution rates and relative brain size following the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event, supporting the hypothesis that emerging ecological opportunities catalysed the diversification of modern birds. The resulting phylogenetic estimate offers fresh insights into the rapid radiation of modern birds and provides a taxon-rich backbone tree for future comparative studies.},
